AloriumTechnology	Ignored my PR for 6 months, then duplicated it (in a half-assed way) the day after I made a bump comment. When I discovered this and complained they responded claiming they didn't know about my PR (hard to believe due to the timing of their commits) and called me "pouty". That comment was later deleted and replaced with one that didn't contain the lie and insults. https://github.com/AloriumTechnology/XLR8LFSR#1
